### Hi there :wave:

I'm Pierluigi and I'm an informatics student of the Sapienza University of Rome. :computer: 
I'm currently waiting for my second year of universty, but I'm actually intrested many fields that 
we have not yet studied, like Etichal Hacking :sunglasses:, Operating Systems, things about Internet protocols and so way.
I want to improve my programming skills :punch: and, if possible, contribute to projects of my interest that make my work 
known to the community :V:. I'm open to the advice of who know better and more than me. :pray:
